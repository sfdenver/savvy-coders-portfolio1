      <!--  Generally, you should have only 1 <h1> per page. 
        Keep your heading tags "in order"
        NEVER use heading tags just to 'style' your text
        'Separation of Concerns' leads to using CSS for style
        Dynamic behavior & functionality is for Javascript-->
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
    <h3>Even smaller...</h3>
    <h6>Quite small</h6>
    <p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>
    <p><em>This is an 'emphasis' tag that will usually render italicised</em></p>
    <p><i>This text is in italics. It is not typically used. However, it is used when wanting 
        to italicise WITHOUT giving additional emphasis.</i></p>
    <p><strong>This is strong or important text.</strong></p>
    <p><b>This text is in bold. Not used unless text should be written in bold
        without having emphasis.</b></p>
    <p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
    <p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK <br> the line, but it's not used very often these days.</p>
    <!--  We should only use the <br> when the line break is actually a part of the content
        - such as in a mailing address, or in a poem.  -->
    <!--  Address is not just for mailing address. It can also be a web address or author-->
